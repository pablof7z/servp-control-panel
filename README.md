# servp-control-panel

This is an old subversion repository converted to git to be archived.

It contains the code that powered the control panel in [Server Protectors](http://serverprotectors.littleq.net).

This code is rusty, lacks a Gemfile, and looks like lots of files had their indentation screwed up. Looking at it reminds of [this thread in Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4816649), particularly the comment "here is something reassuring about looking back and seeing how much you have improved over time."!
